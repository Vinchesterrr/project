    <h2>What is Citrine?</h2>
    <p>Citrine is in the mineral class of quartz. It takes its color from the traces of iron in the quartz and can be anything from pale yellow to bright shades of amber. Citrine tends to have a hexagonal crystal system and in its natural form has a cloudy or smoky look. The meaning of citrine is focused on prosperity, joy, and energy.</p>
    <h2>The stone of Summer</h2>
    <p>The sunshine stone of Citrine is like summer made incarnate. The color of Amalfi Coast lemons, as bright as the midday sun, and with a slight vintage Hollywood vibe, you cannot help but fall hard for the immediate uplifting vibes that sunny Citrine brings to the table. Bright and bustling, this stone is actually a special variety of quartz but comes soaked in a yellow color. Citrine hails from the highlands of Scotland, the flamenco corners of Spain, the tropics of Madagascar, the rich and regal lands of Russia, and the lush green rainforests of Brazil. Perhaps, it's these far-flung places that feed it full of good vibes, or maybe it’s just Mother Nature’s way of reminding us that when life gives you lemons…

        Even as far back as 300 BC, the golden gleam of the Citrine crystal was beloved as a bright decorative gem. Ancient Greek and Roman jewelers would use Citrine to adorn rings to be slipped upon important fingers. But even as time ticked on, Citrine never lost its place in being a beloved jewel. Queen Victoria too loved Citrine and used it to make a statement in her 17th-century costumes. Later, in the new era of Hollywood royalty, stars like Greta Garbo would wear Citrine on the red carpet making it an immortal aspect of art deco style. Citrine meaning comes from the word for lemon, and it's that sweet and sharp citron energy that we adore so much. 
        
        But beyond being a beauty, there are many reasons to bring the splash of Citrine into your life. The power of positivity, a burst of bright energy, and bringing warm light to frayed nerves, Citrine is like a summer holiday for your soul. Let’s delve a little deeper into the sunny rays and healing properties of Citrine.
