    <h2>What Is A Turquoise Crystal?</h2>
    <p>The root of the name ‘turquoise’ has its roots in old French. Translated it means ‘Turkish’ and the general consensus is that this is a nod to its rich history in Persia. The turquoise gemstone is recognised internationally as a traditional 11th anniversary gift while also being one of the three December birthstones.</p>
    <h2>Turquoise Meaning</h2>
    <p>Plunge right into soft still sky-blue waters and cleansing calm energy as you say yes to all that Turquoise has to bring to the table. This beautiful blue stone simmers with all the shades of the ocean, connecting to the throat chakra so you can speak your truth, and ensuring that your inner critic stays shushed.

        With natural shades as pale and clear as the milky way, this sacred stone is dipped in shades of sacred blue-green to bring an extra layer of spiritual cleansing. Blue is the color that calms the soul, that reminds us of the flow of water, the cleansing energy of the earth, and the surge of energy that can come from deep within. With a name from the old French that means Turkish, perhaps in reference to its rich Persian history, the blue Turquoise stone is all about cleansing negative energy and bringing good fortune. 
        
        This stone comes from as far as the winter corners of Nova Scotia to the parched dunes of Namibia, and it brings with it a low humming vibration. Turquoise of a greener hue is also found in the mountainous lands of Tibet. It’s been discovered in the wide and open Mojave desert in California, and in other areas of the USA where Apache mines invited the watery stone to flow out of the earth and into people’s hands.
