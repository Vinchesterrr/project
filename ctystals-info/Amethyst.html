    <p>For those who want to know how to use amethyst in healing; this potent and pretty stone is sure to sweep everyone off their feet and leave all those who wear her gorgeously grounded at the same time. Said to be the bridge that connects the concrete with the divine - the meaning of Amethyst has long been synonymous with spirituality and is famed for its close association with both the third eye and the crown chakra.

        Tracing the lineage of this luminous stone, ancient civilizations have been celebrating the amethyst crystal since 25,000 BC. From the Greeks to the Romans and even the Egyptians, everyone was drawn to the deep healing powers the amethyst stone emanated.
        
        From the ice blasted corners of Siberia to the sultry rainforests of Brazil, Amethyst can be found across the globe. Amethyst means ‘not intoxicated’ and comes from the ancient Greek word – Amethystos. The Greeks, recognizing the grounding poignancy of the stone, thought they could use the crystal to protect them against intoxication and that wearing amethyst would keep them from falling down drunk.
        
        Ever awash with the magic of mythos, there are tales of Amethyst earning its hue from the blood-red wine tears of Dionysus. The story goes that Amethyst was actually a young virgin who found herself on the receiving edge of the Gods wrath when he was drunk.
