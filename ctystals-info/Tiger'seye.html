    <h2>Turquoise Meaning</h2>
    <p>Nicknamed The Shapeshifter, the earthly rich and curious gemstone of Tiger’s Eye invites the wearer to embrace their inner-strength, personal willpower, and to call on the powers of protection. Colored with golden bands, flecks of sand, and smudges of inky black and brown – there’s no disputing the wild force and energy that can be found in this stone. Traditionally the Tiger Eye Gemstone was carried as a protective amulet against the forces of evil. It was said to ward off curses and to keep the wearer safe from ill-wishes. But beyond the powers of protection, the Tiger Eye comes with a whole host of healing properties. From the big cat lands of South Africa, the spice islands and tumbling tea plantations of India, and the arid endless outback of Western Australia, Tiger’s Eye is mined in places where heat, dry air and a sense of wilderness runs rampant. It is formed by altering crocidolite, maintains its mineral rich moods, and takes its golden orb color scheme from iron oxide.
